Description: flexible package manager -- runtime library
 This is a Cupt library implementing high-level package manager for Debian and
 derivatives. It's written with flexibility and reliability in mind and uses
 dpkg as the back-end.
 .
 Provides:
  - parsing and manipulating configuration info;
  - parsing indexes metadata info;
  - version strings comparison;
  - inspection of the binary and source package' versions;
  - parsing and querying info about installed packages;
  - parsing and working with relations and relation expressions;
  - download manager and downloaders for some schemes;
  - problem resolver;
  - worker for modifying system state.
 .

Description: flexible package manager -- console interface
 This package provides a console interface to Cupt library, which implements
 high-level package manager for Debian and derivatives. Cupt is written with
 flexibility and reliability in mind and uses dpkg as the back-end.
 .
 Cupt uses the same APT infrastructure, e.g. index files, deb cache archive
 files, configuration files. It understands some of widely used APT options.
 .
 Some features:
  - strict full-case resolver;
  - resolver reasons tracking;
  - command-line and 'cupt::*' option name checker;
  - case-sensitive search;
  - pinning by source package name;
  - pinning by package groups using shell-like patterns;
  - configurable 'depends' and 'rdepends' subcommands;
  - 'satisfy' subcommand;
  - support of LZMA-compressed indexes;
  - source versions synchronization;
  - 'shell' subcommand (to get command history, search etc. working, install
    the package 'libreadline6');
  - integration with debdelta (to get it, install the package 'debdelta');
  - system snapshots (needs packages 'dpkg-dev' and 'dpkg-repack').
 .
 Its interface is mostly like apt-get/aptitude console interface.
 .
 Cupt has built-in support for APT repositories using the file:// or copy://
 URL schemas. For access to remote repositories using HTTP or FTP, install a
 download method such as libcupt4-1-downloadmethod-curl.
